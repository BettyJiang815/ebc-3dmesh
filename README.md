# ebc-3dmesh
No-reference quality evaluation for textured 3D meshes, quantifying edgeâ€“texture conflicts. It includes Gradient-weighted Normalized Edge Conflict Index (GNECI), Face-Level Edge Conflict Index (FECI), and a mesh-level statistics framework for quality assessment, suitable for multi-resolution meshes and benchmark datasets.
